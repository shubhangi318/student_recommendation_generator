### Quiz Performance Analysis Tool


A Python application that analyzes quiz performance, provides insights on historical data, evaluates current quiz accuracy, and generates visualizations for topic and difficulty-level performance.

## Project Overview

This tool is designed to:
- Fetch and analyze historical quiz performance data.
- Evaluate user performance on the current quiz and compare it with historical trends.
- Generate insightful visualizations for better understanding of strengths and weaknesses by topic and difficulty.

## Key Features

1. Performance Analysis: Breaks down performance by quiz topics and difficulty levels.
2. Historical Comparisons: Tracks user progress against historical averages.
3. Visual Insights: Graphical representations of quiz performance for quick understanding.
4. Configurable Settings: Easily adaptable for different datasets and APIs.

Approach Description
Data Loading

Read current quiz questions (current_quiz.json) and submission responses (quiz_submission.json).
Fetch historical data from the API for trend analysis.
Performance Analysis

Calculate topic-wise and difficulty-level performance from historical data.
Evaluate current quiz accuracy by comparing responses with correct answers.
Identify topics and difficulty levels requiring improvement.
Visualization

Generate bar charts for:
Topic-wise accuracy comparison.
Difficulty-level performance breakdown.
Save visualizations as PNG files for easy sharing.
Insights

Summarize key findings, including top-performing topics and areas needing focus.
Provide actionable recommendations based on accuracy thresholds.
